# Neuron Stimulation System
Source code for CRA final project: Visualizing Neural Plasticity 

Project writeup: https://portfolium.com/entry/visualizing-neural-plasticity-in-2d 

## Usage
Simply build and run the java source code or run the executable! Uses Java Swing UI. 

Click the cells to activate neurons. 
Step or run the time series to see what happens to the stimulation. 
You can choose to have the program auto-stimulate for a random sensory input simulation. 
Make the grid have more cells in each row and column to see even larger patterns!
